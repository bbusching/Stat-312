Our Stat 312 Project

Project Proposal:
Our team is Alexander Lazar, Vihari Muttineni, and Bradley Busching. We are all computer science students. 

Our project's objective is to analyze English text to gain a greater understand of subtle differences in styles(ages) of text. Our primary research questions are as follows: what are the most frequent letters based on word length in English text?; how does this vary based on the type of text(corpus) being analyzed?; what are the most common bi-grams(two consecutive letter combinations) based on word length?; how does that vary based on the type of text?; can any of these results be interpreted to have a specific meaning?

My motivation for the project stemmed from the desire to develop an intelligent hangman artificial intelligence. Vihari liked the idea because of how it tied together with some of the natural language processing he has done. Alex enjoyed the idea of using things we have learned in computer science to help analyze vast amounts of data.

Our variables are the frequency of letters and frequency of bi-grams. We will simply be measuring these as a count, from which we can then calculate frequency. Each of these will be blocked by the length of the word in which they are found. Again we can block these results by the type of text of the data(corpus).

The activities we need to accomplish are as follows: 1. Set up our environment to be able to access and analyze the data. 2. Test the environment to ensure data is being collected correctly. 3. Process the data and store results for easy readability and manipulation. 4. Verify results, checking for any outliers. Ensure no errors occurred in the processing of data. 5. Analyze results and determine method of visualizing resulting data. 6. Interpret results and form any meaningful conclusions. 7. Reflect on the project as a whole; suggest changes/identify errors. 8. Write project report.
